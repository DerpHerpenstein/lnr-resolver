<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Getting a web3 project setup the first time can be a pain.  This should make things a little easier if you are just entering the space.


### Built With


* [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/index.html)
* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/index.html)
* [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

LETS GO!

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed.  For this template I was using v14.17.6

Use NPM to install some needed packages:

* Install Ganache
  ```sh
  npm install ganache -g
  ```
* Install Truffle
  ```sh
  npm install truffle -g

### Installation

Once Ganache and Truffle are installed

1. Navigate to where you want the repo to go
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DerpHerpenstein/MyERC721.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

From the cloned directory, open 3 terminal windows.

In the first terminal, launch ganache:
   ```sh
   ganache -e 10000  -m "nice fetch insect exact south wheel stay pepper section piece tenant select"
   ```

In the second terminal run:
   ```sh
   truffle test
   ```
It should succeed.



In the third terminal run:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

You now have a local blocking, a solidity test environment and starting place for your website.

Now go and build something really cool.
